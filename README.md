## Case Study background
Case Study background - In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. Hence, the task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data

## Goal of the case study

- The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will the following purposes:

- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

- It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

- Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.



## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
